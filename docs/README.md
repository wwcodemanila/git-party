# Welcome to the party!

If you haven't tried using Git before, or have no idea about Git at all, this guide is perfect for you. Are you ready? Let's go!

# What is Git?

> "Git - the stupid content tracker." - [Git Manual](https://freeze.sh/man/git)

Git is a free and open source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations dramatically faster. At present, Git is the most widely used version control system in the world and is considered the modern standard for software development.

## Why is it called *"the stupid content tracker"*?

The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your mood):

* random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
* stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
* "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
* "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

# What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a Git repository hosting service *on steroids*. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

Other Git repo hosting tools:
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)
